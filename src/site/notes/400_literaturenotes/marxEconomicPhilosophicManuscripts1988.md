- political economy, based on avarice, feeds ideas of war, avarice creates competition.
- the worker becomes poorer the more he produces wealth (71). Based on an “actual economic fact”

- [[Labor]] produces:
	- commodities
	- itself
	- the worker _as_ commodity (71)
- labor congeals into an object
	- becomes material
	- this is the objectification of labor
- Labor’s realization is its objectification (71)
- Workers experience loss of reality (estangement)
- objectification becomes the loss of the object and the object bondage.

- the connection is severed in the process of labor under capital (71). 
	- worker relates to his labor as an alien object because it produces commodities, not necessary items with intrinsic use value. 
		- this object is not part of self.
- [[Objectification]]
	- worker uses nature to produce:
		- the sensuous external world; 
		- nature also provides material for our survival.
		- nature provides labor with means of life
			- labor needs objects to operate on for life
- nature also provides means of subsistenec for worker
	- worker appropriates natural world and spends his labor producing objects (commodities) and becomes estranged from self (part of self lost in object)
	- worker becomes slave of his object
		- receives work
		- receives means of subsistence
		- (but connection is severed) between labor and object
- what constitutes the alienation of labor
	- labor is external to the worker
		- doesn’t belong to the worker’s essential being
		- belongs to another (74)
		- estranged labor turns worker’s’ nature and spiritual species property into a being alien to him
			- estranges us from our bodies and from other men

### Notes:

"With the increasing value of the world of things proceeds in direct proportion the devaluation of the world of men" ([p. 71](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/22M76WZW?page=71))

"This fact expresses merely the object which labor produces­ labor's product-confronts it as something alien, as a power independent of the producer. The product of labor is labor which has been congealed in an object, which has become material: it is the objectification of labor. Labor's realization is its objectifi­ cation. In the conditions dealt with by political economy this real­ ization of labor appears as loss of reality for the workers; objec­ tification as loss of the object and object-bondage; appropriation as estrangement, as alienation" ([p. 71](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/22M76WZW?page=71))

"So much does objectification appear as loss of the object that the worker is robbed of the objects most necessary not only for his life but for his work. Indeed, labor itself becomes an object which he can get hold of only with the greatest effort and with the most irregular interruptions. So much does the appropriation of the object appear as estrangement that the more objects the worker produces the fewer can he possess and the more he falls under the dominion of his product, capital" ([p. 71](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/22M76WZW?page=71))

"The worker puts his life into the object; but now his life no longer belongs to him but to the object. Hence, the greater this activity, the greater is the worker's lack of objects. Whatever the product of his labor is, he is not. Therefore the greater this product, the less is he himself. The alienation of the worker in his product means not only that his labor becomes an object, an external existence, but that it exists outside him, independently, as something alien to him, and that it becomes a power on its own confronting him; it means that the life which he has conferred on the object confronts him as something hostile" ([p. 72](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/22M76WZW?page=72))

"(The laws of political economy express the estrangement of the worker in his object thus: the more the worker produces, the less he has to consume; the more values he creates, the more valueless, the more unworthy he becomes; the better formed his product, the more deformed becomes the worker; the more civilized his object, the more barbarous becomes the worker, the mightier labor becomes, the more powerless becomes the worker, the more ingenious labor becomes, the duller becomes the worker and the more he becomes nature's bondsman.) Political economy conceals the estrangement inherent in the nature of labor by not considering the direct relationship between the worker (labor) and production. It is true that labor produces" ([p. 73](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/22M76WZW?page=73))

"The direct relationship of labor to its produce is the relationship of the worker to the objects of his production. The" ([p. 73](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/22M76WZW?page=73))

"But the estrangement is manifested not only in the result but in the act of production within the producing activity itself. How would the worker come to face the product of his activity as a stranger, were it not that in the very act of production he was estranging himself from" ([p. 73](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/22M76WZW?page=73))

"Just as in religion the spontaneous activity of the human imagination, of the human brain and the human heart, operates independently of the individual­ that is, operates on him as an alien, divine or diabolical activity­ in the same way the worker's activity is not his spontaneous activity. It belongs to another; it is the loss of his self." ([p. 74](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/22M76WZW?page=74))

"As a result, therefore, man (the worker) no longer feels himself to be frely active in any but his animal functions-eating, drinking, procreating, or at most in his dwelling and in dressing-up, etc.; and in his human functions he no longer feels himself to be anything but an animal. What is animal becomes human and what is human becomes animal" ([p. 74](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/22M76WZW?page=74))

"Having seen that in relation to the worker who appropriates nature by means of his labor, this appropriation appears as estrangement, his own spontaneous activity as activity for another and as an activity of another, vitality as a sacrifice of life, production of the object as loss of the object to an alien power, to an alien person-we shall now consider the relation to the worker, to labor and its object of this person who is alien to labor and the worker. First it has to be noted, that everything which appears in the worker as an activity of alienation. oj estrangement, appears in the non-worker as a state of alienation, of estrangement. Secondly, that the worker's real, practical attitude in production and to the product (as a state of mind) appears in the non-worker confronting him as a theoretical attitude. Thirdly, the non-worker does everything against the worker which the worker does against himself; but he does not do against himself what he does against the worker. Let us look more closely at these three relations" ([p. 83-84](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/22M76WZW?page=84))


The relationship 
of private property persists as the relationship of the community 
to the world of things. Finally, this movement of counterposing 
universal private property 100



That the entire revolutionary movement necessarily finds both  its empirical and its theoretical basis in the movement of private  property-in that of the economy, to be precise-is easy to see.  This material, immediately sensuous private property is the  material sensuous expression of estranged human life. Its  movement-production and consumption-is the sensuous  revelation of the movement of all production hitherto-i.e. , the realization or the reality of man. Religion, family, state, law, 
morality, science, art, etc. , are only particular modes of production, 
and fall under its general law . The positive transcendence of private 
property at the appropriation of human life is, therefore, the 
positive transcendence of al estrangement-that is to say, the 
return of man from religion, family, state, etc., to his human, 
i.e., social mode of existence. Religious

Activity and consumption, both in their content and 
in their mode of existence, are social: social activity and social 
consumption; the human essence of nature first exists only for 
social man; for only here does nature exist for him as a bond 
with man-as his existence for the other and the other's existence 
for him-as the life-element of the human world; only here does 
nature exist as the foundation of his own human existence. Only 
here has what is to him his natural existence become his human 
existence, and nature become man for him. Thus society is the 
consummated oneness in substance of man and nature-the true 
resurrection of nature-the [[100_Keytopics/111_Genres/Naturalism|naturalism]] of man and the humanism 
of nature both brought to fulfilment.

My general consciousness is only the theoretical shape of 
that of which the living shape is the real community, the social 
fabric, although at the present day general consciousness is an 
abstraction from real life and as such antagonistically confronts 
it. Consequently, too, the activity of my general consciousness, 
as an activity, is my theoretical existence as a social being
【Annotations】105



What is to be avoided above al is the re-establishing of 
"Society" as an abstraction vis-a-vis the indvidual. The individual 
is the social being. His life, even if it may not appear in the 
direct form of a communal life carried out together with othersis therefore an expression and confirmation of social life. Man's  individual and species life are not diferent, however much-and 
this is inevitable-the mode of existence of the individual is a  more particular, or more general mode of the life of the species, or the life of the species is a more particular or more general 
individual life.
【Annotations】105


his consciousness of species man confirms his real social 
life and simply repeats his real existence in thought, just as 
conversely the being of the species confirms itself in species consciousness and is for itself in its generality as a thinking being. 
Man, much as he may therefore be a particular individual 
(and it is preciSely his particularity which makes him an individual, 
and a real individual social being), is just as much the totality
the ideal totality-the subjective existence of thought and 
experienced society present for itself; just as he exists also in 
the real world as the awareness and the real enjoyment of social 
existence, and as a totality of human life-activity.

But since for the socialist man the entire so-caOed history 
of the world is nothing but the begetting of man through human 
labor, nothing but the corning-to-be of nature for man, he has 
the visible, irrefutable proof of his birth through himself, of his 
process of coming-to-be

The extent to which the solution 
of theoretical riddles is the task of practice and effected through 
practice, just as true practice is the condition of a real and positive 
theory, is shown, for example, in fetishism. The sensuous 
consciousness of the fetish-worshipper is different from that of 
the Greek, because his sensuous existence is still different. The 
abstract enmity between sense and spirit is necessary so long 
as the human feeling for nature, the human sense of nature, 
and therefore also the natural sense of man, are not yet produced 
by man's own labor.

Estrangement is manifested not only in the fact that my 
means of life belong to someone else, that my desire is the 
inaccessible possession of another, but also in the fact that 
everything is in itself something diferent from itself-that my 
activity is something else and that, finally (and this applies also 
to the capitalist), all is under the sway of inhuman power. There 
is a form of inactive, extravagant wealth given over wholly to 
pleasure, the enjoyer of which on the one hand behaves as a 
mere ephemeral individual frantically spending himself to no 
purpose, knows the slave-labor of others (human sweat and 
blood) as the prey of his cupidity, and therefore knows man 
himself, and hence also his own self, as a sacrificed and empty 
being

Society, as it appears to the political economist, is civil society, 
in which every individual is a totality of needs and only exists 
for the other person, as the other exists for him, insofar as 
each becomes a means for the other. The political economist 
reduces everything Gust as does politics in its Rights of Man) 
to man, i.e., to the individual whom he strips of all determinateness so as to class him as capitalist or worker. 
The division of labor is the expression in political economy 
of the social character of labor within the estrangement. Or, 
since labor is only an expression of human activity within 
alienation, of the living of life as the alienating of life, the division 
of labor, too, is therefore nothing else but the estranged, alienated 
positing of human activity as a real activity of the species or 
as activity of man as a species being. 
As for the essence of the division of labor-and of course 
the division of labor had to be conceived as a major driving 
force in the production of wealth as soon as labor was recognized 
as the essence of private property-Le., about the estranged and 
alienated form of human activity as an activity of the speciesthe political economists are very unclear and self-contradictory 
about it.
